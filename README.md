Tower is a smart tool for legal teams that helps them manage and organize requests they receive.
Here’s how it works:
- Request Handling: When someone sends a legal question or request via Slack, Teams, or email, Tower automatically collects all the needed information and sets up a case file.
- Tracking Progress: It keeps track of how each case is doing through a single, easy-to-use dashboard.
- Performance Insights: The tool also shows important performance metrics to help the team see how well they are doing.
In short, Tower helps legal teams handle requests more efficiently and keep track of their work without getting overwhelmed.
